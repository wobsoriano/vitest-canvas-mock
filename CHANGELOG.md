# vitest-canvas-mock

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 844d2fe: - **Breaking**: Peer dependency now requires Vitest 3.x or 4.x (previously allowed any version)
  - Added `setupVitestCanvasMock()` export function for manual setup (similar to jest-canvas-mock's `setupJestCanvasMock()`)
  - Improved test coverage
