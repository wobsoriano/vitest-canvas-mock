"vitest-canvas-mock": minor
---

This project is now established as a direct fork of `jest-canvas-mock`, migrated to work with Vitest.

### Changes

- Updated function name references and documentation to use Vitest terminology
- Updated type definitions and comments to reference `vitest-canvas-mock` instead of `jest-canvas-mock`
- No API changes - the function has always been `setupVitestCanvasMock()` in this fork
